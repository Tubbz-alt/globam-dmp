# US radar data (`pvol`)

This chapter describes polar volume (`pvol`) data from weather radars in the United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov)) operates a network of approximately 160 Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD), WSR-88D sites in the US and associated territories. 

## Source

Archived polar volumes (pvols) (called “level II data” in the US) are stored on various services:

1. Amazon S3, see [NEXRAD on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/). Archived data are hosted in the [noaa-nexrad-level2](https://noaa-nexrad-level2.s3.amazonaws.com) Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 AWS region. These data are made available 10-20 minutes lag relative to real-time. There is also a real-time data stream, for which scans have not been merged yet into polar volumes.
2. Google Cloud, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/nexrad

## License

There are no restrictions on the use of this data.

## Format

From the AWS open data project [documentation](https://docs.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/readme.html) for archive data:

> Each volume scan file of archival data is available as an object in Amazon S3. The basic data format is:
> 
> `/<Year>/<Month>/<Day>/<NEXRAD Station/>/<filename>`
> 
> Where:
> 
> - `<Year>` is the year the data was collected
> - `<Month>` is the month of the year the data was collected
> - `<Day>` is the day of the month the data was collected
> - `<NEXRAD Station>` is the NEXRAD ground station (map of ground stations)
> - `<filename>` is the name of the file containing the data. These are compressed files (compressed with gzip). The file name has more precise timestamp information.
> 
> All files in the archive use the same compressed format (.gz). The data file names are, for example, `KAKQ20010101_080138.gz`. The file naming convention is:
> 
> `GGGGYYYYMMDD_TTTTTT`
> 
> Where:
> 
> - `GGGG` = Ground station ID (map of ground stations)
> - `YYYY` = year
> - `MM` = month
> - `DD` = day
> - `TTTTTT` = time when data started to be collected (GMT)
> 
> Note that the 2015 files have an additional field on the file name. It adds “_V06” to the end of the file name. An example is KABX20150303_001050_V06.gz.

## Geographical scope

The NEXRAD network covers continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, South Korea and Puerto Rico. Sites in use vary slightly over time, see [here](https://www.roc.noaa.gov/wsr88d/Level_II/Level2Info.aspx) for more information, [maps](https://www.roc.noaa.gov/WSR88D/Maps.aspx) here.

## Temporal scope

The archive spans from June 1991 to present. However, during this time significant changes have been made. A resolution increase was implemented in 2008-2009 (so-called superresolution data). Dual polarization capabilities were added in 2010-2013.
