# Processing pipeline

This chapter describes the processing pipeline from `pvol` over `vp` to `vpts` data.

## European `pvol` {#baltrad-pvol}

[BALTRAD](http://baltrad.eu/) collects `pvol` data for Europe. For `pvol` data to be available in BALTRAD, several conditions [need to be met](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird/wiki/Radar-data-requirements-and-availability-for-ENRAM#future-radar-data-availability-for-enram):

1. A country should send both reflectivity and radial velocity data to the [OPERA](http://www.eumetnet.eu/opera) data centre, which is called [ODYSSEY](http://www.eumetnet.eu/odyssey-opera-data-centre). While many countries are sending reflectivity data, radial velocities are still unavailable for many countries.
2. ODYSSEY should forward these data to the BALTRAD datahub. It is standard policy to do so, but in practice data is not yet forwarded correctly for some radars/countries. 
3. Currently BALTRAD and ODYSSEY store data at a 15 minute interval, higher resolution data is not yet available.

## European `pvol` to `vp`

A server at BALTRAD processes any incoming `pvol` data with [`vol2bird`](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird). This pipeline is maintained by GÃ¼nther Haase ([SMHI](https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/atmospheric-remote-sensing/contact-us-1.4801)).

The resulting `vp` files are stored for 2 days on a private FTP server to which we have access. The used `vol2bird` version is stored in the metadata of the `vp` files and can differ over time. The latest files are created with `vol2bird 0.3.20` (last tested April 11, 2019).

## `vp` archiving {#enram-pipeline}

**European** `vp` data are archived daily by a pipeline running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which transfers `vp` files from the BALTRAD FTP server to a public [S3 bucket](https://lw-enram.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com). This pipeline is maintained by Stijn Van Hoey ([Open science lab for biodiversity](https://twitter.com/oscibio)) and its code and documentation are available in [this repository](https://github.com/enram/data-repository). Note that any issues in the pipeline that are not resolved within 2 days (the time `vp` data are kept on the FTP server) **can result in data loss**.

The pipeline also updates a [coverage file](https://lw-enram.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/coverage.csv) and bundles `vp` files in monthly zips per radar (e.g. [`bejab201904.zip`](https://lw-enram.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/be/jab/2019/bejab201904.zip)). A [public website][enram-repo] allows easier file navigation of the S3 bucket.

**United States** `vp` data are currently not archived. See [issue](https://github.com/enram/globam-dmp/issues/19).

## `vp` to `vpts`

Not yet defined, but likely part of the ENRAM pipeline (see \@ref(enram-pipeline)).
