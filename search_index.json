["1_introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Research purpose 1.2 Data manager 1.3 How this DMP is maintained", " 1 Introduction 1.1 Research purpose Migratory animals play significant roles in shaping ecosystems through a variety of transport and trophic effects that also represent services and disservices to human infrastructure, agriculture and welfare. Their aerial and terrestrial habitats have changed dramatically over the past decades and are expected to change further, particularly due to rapid climate change, increased urbanization, wind energy installations, and habitat fragmentation. Within GloBAM: Towards monitoring, understanding and forecasting global biomass flows of aerial migrants, we aim to use weather radar data to quantify the biomass flows of aerial migrants (birds, insects and bats) from regional to continental scales across Europe and North America, over time-scales from days to years. We are particularly interested in identifying the drivers of migrant movements and abundances and will relate the timing and intensity of movements to a suite of atmospheric, climatic and landscape variables, exploring the implications for aerial migrants in a changing world. For more information on GloBAM, see the project website. 1.2 Data manager Peter Desmet is responsible for data management and DMP maintenance in GloBAM. He is also leading WP1 - Data infrastructure. Peter works as open data coordinator for the Open science lab for biodiversity at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). He and his team have extensive expertise and experience with data management and open data publication meeting FAIR principles. 1.3 How this DMP is maintained This DMP is maintained and versioned on GitHub at https://github.com/enram/globam-dmp/. Each chapter is an R Markdown file (Rmd) in the src directory of that GitHub repository. You can access it directly by clicking the pencil icon in the top navigation of the website version of this DMP. Changes to the R Markdown files can be made by contributors to the GitHub repository or suggested by anyone as pull requests. Textual changes can be done directly on GitHub, code changes are better tested in RStudio first. Accepted changes (i.e. changes to the master branch) will trigger an automatic build procedure that will generate a new version of the DMP using the R package bookdown. The date of the build is used as the version number. "],
["2_pvol_europe.html", "2 European radar data (pvol) 2.1 Data collecting 2.2 Access 2.3 License 2.4 Geographical scope 2.5 Temporal scope 2.6 Format &amp; file names 2.7 Quality assurance 2.8 Storage &amp; backup", " 2 European radar data (pvol) This chapter describes polar volume (pvol) data from European weather radars: one the main data sources for GloBAM. 2.1 Data collecting European pvol data are collected by weather radars from national weather services in Europe. 2.2 Access The national weather services have different approaches in processing, archiving and providing access to pvol data (from restricted access to open data). Even though some GloBAM partners (e.g. the University of Amsterdam) have archived subsets of these data for research use, the scattered scope and access to European pvol data is a serious barrier to GloBAM, which ideally requires access to all European pvol data using the same protocol. The best source for consolidated pvol data is therefore BALTRAD, managed by SMHI (contact person: Günther Haase). pvol data are archived there, but access to that server is restricted to SMHI. See 5.1 for details on how pvol data are submitted to this archive. The rest of this chapter discusses the specifics of the BALTRAD archive. 2.3 License European radar data exchange is coordinated by the European Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information (EUMETNET/OPERA). GloBAM has access to these data via the EIG EUMETNET license agreement for Research use of OPERA data, which grants a specific list of people (involved in ENRAM and GloBAM) access to radar data from selected countries under the following conditions (excerpt): The Licensor grants the Licensees a non-Exclusive license to use intellectual property belonging to the EUMETNET members as defined below [ … ] The OPERA Members Data will be provided for use within the ENRAM Project for the purpose of extracting animal migration information for scientific research. The Grant of this License does not permit use of the OPERA Members Data licensed to be used for commercial purposes or exploitation for profit. The license agreement allows us to access European pvol data for the sole purpose of extracting animal migration information for scientific research, which is what GloBAM intends to do. Storing, sharing or other use of these data is restricted and requires prior written consent of the Licensor. 2.4 Geographical scope OPERA manages a list of radars, their unique codes (e.g. odimcode) and associated metadata. The list currently contains 232 radars. This OPERA database is available as an interactive map derived from a json file containing the metadata. To keep track of changes, we archive this json on GitHub every time we update the DMP. The license agreement allows access to data from 19 countries: country iso_code radars operational Austria AT 5 5 Belgium BE 3 3 Croatia HR 5 2 Czechia CZ 2 2 Denmark DK 5 5 Estonia EE 2 2 Finland FI 10 10 France FR 31 25 Germany DE 20 20 Netherlands NL 3 2 Norway NO 11 11 Poland PL 8 8 Portugal PT 4 3 Slovakia SK 4 4 Slovenia SI 2 2 Spain ES 15 15 Sweden SE 12 12 Switzerland CH 5 5 United Kingdom GB 16 16 Total - 163 152 The BALTRAD archive does not contain pvol data for all of these radars/countries however (see 5.1). Its precise geographical scope is currently unknown, but being gathered. 2.5 Temporal scope The temporal scope of the BALTRAD archive is currently unknown, but being gathered. GloBAM needs a 2-3 year archive of European pvol and derived vp data to tackle its research questions. By starting from a pvol archive, the generation of vp data can be reproduced if need be, e.g. to make sure adequate vol2bird settings/versions are used. The pvol archive at BALTRAD is likely to be the best source for this archive, but its scope and quality need to be assessed before we can proceed, see 2.7. 2.6 Format &amp; file names The delivery of European pvol data is defined in the license agreement: The Licensor will make the OPERA Members Data available to the Licensees in accordance to the following data description and technical specifications: Single-site polar volumes containing reflectivity, optionally also Doppler velocity, uncorrected reflectivity and dual-pol parameters. Data model ODIM as described in OPERA pages of the EUMETNET website (http://www.eumetnet.eu) Update frequency – 15 minutes Issue time – up to 120 minutes after data time Format: HDF5 Delivery method: FTP via Internet using an ad hoc server. A username and password will be created for ENRAM. Availability of OPERA Members Data will be on the basis of reasonable endeavour Support: OPERA documents are available from the EUMETNET website’s OPERA pages (http://www.eumetnet.eu). OPERA Program Manager will manage technical questions related to the OPERA Products but may address more complicated issues to a team member who may charge a fee. Data is thus provided for every 15 minutes as hdf5 in the OPERA ODIM_h5 format. These files can be read in bioRad with read_pvolfile(). File names are generally of the format bejab_pvol_20190620T055500Z_0x9.h5, where: be: two-letter code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) jab: three-letter code (last 3 letters from the ODIM code, see 2.4) _pvol_: indication that this is a pvol data file 20190620: date in yyyymmdd format T055000Z: time in hhmmss format + timezone (Z for UTC time) _0x9: suffix (to be ignored) 2.7 Quality assurance The scope and quality of the BALTRAD archive need to be assessed. Tasks for this are listed here and include: Get a file listing for pvol archive Select subsets: first 2 days of data per radar/month for 2016, 2017, 2018 (72 days): either pvol or pre-merged scans Transfer subsets to accessible FTP server Merge to pvol (test 1) Process with vol2bird to vp (test 2) Store output vp files Visual control of vp (test 3) 2.8 Storage &amp; backup The BALTRAD archive is stored on a restricted FTP server. It is maintained by SMHI. "],

Archived data are hosted in the noaa-nexrad-level2 Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 AWS region. These data are made available 10-20 minutes lag relative to real-time. There is also a real-time data stream, for which scans have not been merged yet into polar volumes. Google Cloud. 3.3 License There are no restrictions on the use of these data. 3.4 Geographical scope The NEXRAD network covers continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, South Korea and Puerto Rico. Sites in use vary slightly over time, see here for more information, maps here. Figure 3.1: NEXRAD radar network in the lower 48 states 3.5 Temporal scope The archive spans from June 1991 to present. However, during this time significant changes have been made. A resolution increase was implemented in 2008-2009 (so-called superresolution data). Dual polarization capabilities were added in 2010-2013. 3.6 Format &amp; file names See this page for available decoding tools of the radar format. US pvol data can be read in bioRad with read_pvolfile(). From the AWS open data project documentation for archive data: Each volume scan file of archival data is available as an object in Amazon S3. The basic data format is: /&lt;Year&gt;/&lt;Month&gt;/&lt;Day&gt;/&lt;NEXRAD Station/&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; Where: &lt;Year&gt; is the year the data was collected &lt;Month&gt; is the month of the year the data was collected &lt;Day&gt; is the day of the month the data was collected &lt;NEXRAD Station&gt; is the NEXRAD ground station (map of ground stations) &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file containing the data. These are compressed files (compressed with gzip). The file name has more precise timestamp information. All files in the archive use the same compressed format (.gz). The data file names are, for example, KAKQ20010101_080138.gz. The file naming convention is: GGGGYYYYMMDD_TTTTTT Where: GGGG = Ground station ID (map of ground stations) YYYY = year MM = month DD = day TTTTTT = time when data started to be collected (GMT) Note that the 2015 files have an additional field on the file name. It adds “_V06” to the end of the file name. An example is KABX20150303_001050_V06.gz. 3.7 Quality assurance Unknown. 3.8 Storage &amp; backup US pvol data are stored on AWS and other cloud services, see 3.2. "],

["5_pipeline.html", "5 Processing pipeline 5.1 European pvol 5.2 European pvol to vp 5.3 vp archiving 5.4 vp to vpts", " 5 Processing pipeline This chapter describes the processing pipeline from pvol over vp to vpts data. 5.1 European pvol BALTRAD collects pvol data for Europe. For pvol data to be available in BALTRAD, several conditions need to be met: A country should send both reflectivity and radial velocity data to the OPERA data centre, which is called ODYSSEY. While many countries are sending reflectivity data, radial velocities are still unavailable for many countries. ODYSSEY should forward these data to the BALTRAD datahub. It is standard policy to do so, but in practice data is not yet forwarded correctly for some radars/countries. Currently BALTRAD and ODYSSEY store data at a 15 minute interval, higher resolution data is not yet available. 5.2 European pvol to vp A server at BALTRAD processes any incoming pvol data with vol2bird. This pipeline is maintained by Günther Haase (SMHI). The resulting vp files are stored for 2 days on a private FTP server to which we have access. The used vol2bird version is stored in the metadata of the vp files and can differ over time. The latest files are created with vol2bird 0.3.20 (last tested April 11, 2019). 5.3 vp archiving European vp data are archived daily by a pipeline running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which transfers vp files from the BALTRAD FTP server to a public S3 bucket. This pipeline is maintained by Stijn Van Hoey (Open science lab for biodiversity) and its code and documentation are available in this repository. Note that any issues in the pipeline that are not resolved within 2 days (the time vp data are kept on the FTP server) can result in data loss. The pipeline also updates a coverage file and bundles vp files in monthly zips per radar (e.g. bejab201904.zip). A public website allows easier file navigation of the S3 bucket. United States vp data are currently not archived. See issue. 5.4 vp to vpts Not yet defined, but likely part of the ENRAM pipeline (see 5.3). "],
["6_vp.html", "6 Vertical profiles of aerial migrants data (vp) 6.1 Source 6.2 License 6.3 Format 6.4 Geographical scope 6.5 Temporal scope", " 6 Vertical profiles of aerial migrants data (vp) This chapter describes vertical profiles of aerial migrants/biological signals (vp) data for Europe and the United States. Vertical profiles contain the speed, direction and density of aerial migrants at different altitudes for a specific radar location and time, and form the source data for GloBAM specifically and aeroecological research in general. 6.1 Source European vp data are generated daily from pvol data on the BALTRAD server and then transferred to the public ENRAM data repository (see 5.3). United States vp data are being generated for the 25 year pvol archive, but not yet publicly archived. vp files can be downloaded from the ENRAM data repository individually, as monthly zips, or automatically in bioRad with download_vpfiles(). 6.2 License Data in the ENRAM data repository are available as open data under a Creative Commons Zero waiver. For the European data it is recommended to acknowledge EUMETNET/OPERA in publications resulting from the use of these data as follows: We acknowledge the European Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information (EUMETNET/OPERA) for providing access to European radar data, faciliated through a research-only license agreement between EUMETNET/OPERA members and ENRAM. 6.3 Format A vp file is generated for each originating pvol file and thus has the same granularity. vp data are stored as hdf5 files in the ODIM bird profile format specification. These files can be read in bioRad with read_vpfiles(). 6.4 Geographical scope The coverage of the ENRAM data repository is recorded daily in coverage.csv and summarized here: radar 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total bejab 21 NA 194 173 388 bewid 19 12 205 171 407 bezav 21 NA NA NA 21 bgvar 21 NA NA NA 21 ctcdv 21 NA NA NA 21 ctpda 21 NA NA NA 21 czbrd 21 NA 286 172 479 czska 21 NA 286 174 481 deasb NA NA 221 93 314 deboo 31 17 305 93 446 dedrs 31 21 304 93 449 deeis 31 21 304 93 449 deemd NA 20 49 NA 69 deess 31 21 304 93 449 defbg 31 NA NA NA 31 defld 31 21 303 92 447 deflg NA 21 49 NA 70 dehnr 31 21 304 93 449 deisn 31 NA NA NA 31 demem 31 21 301 93 446 deneu 31 21 301 93 446 denhb 31 21 300 90 442 deoft 31 21 304 93 449 depro 31 21 302 93 447 deros 25 21 294 93 433 desna NA 21 303 93 417 detur 29 21 303 93 446 deumd 31 21 304 93 449 dkbor NA 34 85 176 295 dkrom NA 38 85 175 298 dksin NA 38 85 176 299 dkste NA 38 85 175 298 dkvir NA 27 85 176 288 eehar NA 20 35 1 56 eesur NA 20 35 NA 55 esalm NA 38 287 167 492 esbad NA 38 302 167 507 esbar NA 38 303 168 509 escor NA 38 287 167 492 eslid NA 38 303 167 508 eslpa NA NA 14 NA 14 esmad NA 38 301 167 506 esmal NA 38 303 168 509 esmur NA 38 302 167 507 espma NA 38 303 166 507 essan NA 38 302 167 507 essev NA 36 300 164 500 essse NA 38 303 161 502 esval NA 38 294 167 499 eszar NA 38 303 163 504 fianj 22 154 38 NA 214 fiika 22 153 39 NA 214 fikes 22 151 38 NA 211 fikor 22 146 38 NA 206 fikuo 22 156 38 NA 216 filuo 22 153 38 NA 213 fipet 22 99 NA NA 121 fiuta 22 157 38 NA 217 fivan 22 157 39 NA 218 fivim 22 132 34 NA 188 frabb 21 38 320 166 545 frale 21 26 321 175 543 frave 21 NA 283 176 480 frbla 21 38 321 167 547 frbol 21 38 279 140 478 frbor 21 36 321 176 554 frbou 21 38 173 173 405 frcae 21 38 320 175 554 frche 21 38 317 166 542 frcol 21 38 312 175 546 frgre 21 38 320 171 550 frlep 21 38 320 166 545 frmcl 21 38 304 175 538 frmom 21 38 320 176 555 frmtc 21 35 302 161 519 frnan 21 38 317 175 551 frnim 21 38 320 176 555 frniz 21 NA 281 176 478 fropo 21 38 241 59 359 frpla 21 38 315 176 550 frtou 21 37 305 176 539 frtra 21 38 320 176 555 frtre 6 38 316 176 536 frtro 21 NA 282 175 478 hrbil NA 38 35 NA 73 hrosi NA 38 35 NA 73 nldbl 22 4 NA NA 26 nldhl 21 125 295 175 616 nlhrw NA 21 294 175 490 plbrz 21 3 261 174 459 plgda 21 3 261 173 458 plleg 21 3 259 174 457 plpas NA 3 259 174 436 plpoz 21 3 260 174 458 plram 21 3 260 174 458 plrze 21 3 222 175 421 plswi 21 3 260 174 458 ptfar 119 NA NA 21 140 ptlis NA NA NA 5 5 ptliz 122 NA NA NA 122 ptprt 113 NA NA 59 172 seang 21 137 310 136 604 searl 21 153 318 123 615 sease 21 16 NA NA 37 seatv NA NA NA 11 11 sehem NA 43 314 165 522 sehud 21 NA NA NA 21 sehuv NA 36 295 166 497 sekaa NA NA NA 70 70 sekir 21 144 318 176 659 sekkr 21 157 171 NA 349 selek 21 118 208 160 507 sella NA NA NA 69 69 selul 21 148 183 NA 352 seoer NA 36 307 167 510 seosd NA 142 311 163 616 seosu 13 NA NA NA 13 seovi 21 59 NA NA 80 sevar 21 NA NA NA 21 sevax NA 133 312 161 606 sevil 21 153 318 29 521 silis 21 35 304 170 530 sipas 21 35 311 139 506 skjav NA 38 301 175 514 skkoj NA 38 301 168 507 skkub NA NA 280 174 454 sklaz NA NA 280 176 456 6.5 Temporal scope Data transfer to the ENRAM data repository become more or less operational in March 2018 (with a gap in July 2018).
