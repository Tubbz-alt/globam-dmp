["pvol_europe.html", "2 European radar data (pvol) 2.1 Source 2.2 License 2.3 Format 2.4 Geographical scope 2.5 Temporal scope 2.6 Historical archive", " 2 European radar data (pvol) This chapter describes polar volume (pvol) data from European weather radars. 2.1 Source pvol data are collected by national weather services in Europe. They have different approaches in processing, archiving and providing access to these data. Some research labs (e.g. UvA) also have archived subsets of these pvol data for research use. The best source for consolidated pvol data however is BALTRAD, managed by SMHI (contact person: Günther Haase). pvol data are archived there, but access to that server is restricted to SMHI. See 6.1 for details on how pvol data are submitted to this archive. The rest of this chapter discusses the specifics of the BALTRAD archive. 2.2 License European radar data exchange is coordinated by the European Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information (EUMETNET/OPERA). GloBAM has access to these data via the EIG EUMETNET license agreement for Research use of OPERA data, which grants a specific list of people (involved in ENRAM and GloBAM) access to radar data from selected countries under the following conditions (excerpt): The Licensor grants the Licensees a non-Exclusive license to use intellectual property belonging to the EUMETNET members as defined below [ … ] The OPERA Members Data will be provided for use within the ENRAM Project for the purpose of extracting animal migration information for scientific research. The Grant of this License does not permit use of the OPERA Members Data licensed to be used for commercial purposes or exploitation for profit. The license agreement allows us to access European pvol data for the sole purpose of extracting animal migration information for scientific research. Storing, sharing or other use of these data is restricted and requires prior written consent of the Licensor. 2.3 Format The delivery of European pvol data is defined in the license agreement: The Licensor will make the OPERA Members Data available to the Licensees in accordance to the following data description and technical specifications: Single-site polar volumes containing reflectivity, optionally also Doppler velocity, uncorrected reflectivity and dual-pol parameters. Data model ODIM as described in OPERA pages of the EUMETNET website (http://www.eumetnet.eu) Update frequency – 15 minutes Issue time – up to 120 minutes after data time Format: HDF5 Delivery method: FTP via Internet using an ad hoc server. A username and password will be created for ENRAM. Availability of OPERA Members Data will be on the basis of reasonable endeavour Support: OPERA documents are available from the EUMETNET website’s OPERA pages (http://www.eumetnet.eu). OPERA Program Manager will manage technical questions related to the OPERA Products but may address more complicated issues to a team member who may charge a fee. Data is thus provided for every 15 minutes as hdf5 in the OPERA ODIM_h5 format. These files can be read in bioRad with read_pvolfile(). 2.4 Geographical scope OPERA manages a list of radar metadata (232 radars). This OPERA database is available as an interactive map derived from a json file containing the metadata. To keep track of changes, we archive this json on GitHub every time we update the DMP. The license agreement allows access to data from 19 countries: country iso_code radars operational Austria AT 5 5 Belgium BE 3 3 Croatia HR 5 2 Czechia CZ 2 2 Denmark DK 5 5 Estonia EE 2 2 Finland FI 10 10 France FR 31 25 Germany DE 20 20 Netherlands NL 3 2 Norway NO 11 11 Poland PL 8 8 Portugal PT 4 3 Slovakia SK 4 4 Slovenia SI 2 2 Spain ES 15 15 Sweden SE 12 12 Switzerland CH 5 5 United Kingdom GB 16 16 Total - 163 152 The BALTRAD archive does not contain pvol data for all of these radars/countries however (see 6.1). Its precise geographical scope is currently unknown, but being gathered in this spreadsheet. 2.5 Temporal scope The temporal scope of the BALTRAD archive is currently unknown. 2.6 Historical archive GloBAM needs a 2-3 year archive of European pvol and derived vp data to tackle its research questions. By starting from a pvol archive, the generation of vp data can be reproduced if need be, e.g. to make sure adequate vol2bird settings/versions are used. The pvol archive at BALTRAD is likely to be the best source for this archive, but its scope and quality need to be assessed before we can proceed. Tasks for this are listed here and include: Get a file listing for pvol archive Select subsets: first 2 days of data per radar/month for 2016, 2017, 2018 (72 days): either pvol or pre-merged scans Transfer subsets to accessible FTP server Merge to pvol (test 1) Process with vol2bird to vp (test 2) Store output vp files Visual control of vp (test 3) "],

Vertical profiles contain the speed, direction and density of aerial migrants at different altitudes for a specific radar location and time, and form the source data for GloBAM specifically and aeroecological research in general. 4.1 Source European vp data are generated daily from pvol data on the BALTRAD server and then transferred to the public ENRAM data repository (see 6.3). United States vp data are being generated for the 25 year pvol archive, but not yet publicly archived. vp files can be downloaded from the ENRAM data repository individually, as monthly zips, or automatically in bioRad with download_vpfiles(). 4.2 License Data in the ENRAM data repository are available as open data under a Creative Commons Zero waiver. For the European data it is recommended to acknowledge EUMETNET/OPERA in publications resulting from the use of these data as follows: We acknowledge the European Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information (EUMETNET/OPERA) for providing access to European radar data, faciliated through a research-only license agreement between EUMETNET/OPERA members and ENRAM. 4.3 Format A vp file is generated for each originating pvol file and thus has the same granularity. vp data are stored as hdf5 files in the ODIM bird profile format specification. These files can be read in bioRad with read_vpfiles(). 4.4 Geographical scope The coverage of the ENRAM data repository is recorded daily in coverage.csv and summarized here: radar 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total bejab 21 NA 194 114 329 bewid 19 12 205 111 347 bezav 21 NA NA NA 21 bgvar 21 NA NA NA 21 ctcdv 21 NA NA NA 21 ctpda 21 NA NA NA 21 czbrd 21 NA 286 114 421 czska 21 NA 286 115 422 deasb NA NA 221 93 314 deboo 31 17 305 93 446 dedrs 31 21 304 93 449 deeis 31 21 304 93 449 deemd NA 20 49 NA 69 deess 31 21 304 93 449 defbg 31 NA NA NA 31 defld 31 21 303 92 447 deflg NA 21 49 NA 70 dehnr 31 21 304 93 449 deisn 31 NA NA NA 31 demem 31 21 301 93 446 deneu 31 21 301 93 446 denhb 31 21 300 90 442 deoft 31 21 304 93 449 depro 31 21 302 93 447 deros 25 21 294 93 433 desna NA 21 303 93 417 detur 29 21 303 93 446 deumd 31 21 304 93 449 dkbor NA 34 85 115 234 dkrom NA 38 85 115 238 dksin NA 38 85 115 238 dkste NA 38 85 115 238 dkvir NA 27 85 115 227 eehar NA 20 35 1 56 eesur NA 20 35 NA 55 esalm NA 38 287 115 440 esbad NA 38 302 115 455 esbar NA 38 303 115 456 escor NA 38 287 115 440 eslid NA 38 303 115 456 eslpa NA NA 14 NA 14 esmad NA 38 301 115 454 esmal NA 38 303 115 456 esmur NA 38 302 115 455 espma NA 38 303 115 456 essan NA 38 302 115 455 essev NA 36 300 115 451 essse NA 38 303 115 456 esval NA 38 294 115 447 eszar NA 38 303 112 453 fianj 22 154 38 NA 214 fiika 22 153 39 NA 214 fikes 22 151 38 NA 211 fikor 22 146 38 NA 206 fikuo 22 156 38 NA 216 filuo 22 153 38 NA 213 fipet 22 99 NA NA 121 fiuta 22 157 38 NA 217 fivan 22 157 39 NA 218 fivim 22 132 34 NA 188 frabb 21 38 320 105 484 frale 21 26 321 115 483 frave 21 NA 283 115 419 frbla 21 38 321 113 493 frbol 21 38 279 109 447 frbor 21 36 321 115 493 frbou 21 38 173 112 344 frcae 21 38 320 115 494 frche 21 38 317 115 491 frcol 21 38 312 114 485 frgre 21 38 320 110 489 frlep 21 38 320 110 489 frmcl 21 38 304 115 478 frmom 21 38 320 115 494 frmtc 21 35 302 115 473 frnan 21 38 317 115 491 frnim 21 38 320 115 494 frniz 21 NA 281 115 417 fropo 21 38 241 59 359 frpla 21 38 315 115 489 frtou 21 37 305 115 478 frtra 21 38 320 115 494 frtre 6 38 316 115 475 frtro 21 NA 282 114 417 hrbil NA 38 35 NA 73 hrosi NA 38 35 NA 73 nldbl 22 4 NA NA 26 nldhl 21 125 295 115 556 nlhrw NA 21 294 115 430 plbrz 21 3 261 115 400 plgda 21 3 261 115 400 plleg 21 3 259 115 398 plpas NA 3 259 115 377 plpoz 21 3 260 115 399 plram 21 3 260 115 399 plrze 21 3 222 115 361 plswi 21 3 260 115 399 ptfar 119 NA NA 6 125 ptlis NA NA NA 1 1 ptliz 122 NA NA NA 122 ptprt 113 NA NA 2 115 seang 21 137 310 103 571 searl 21 153 318 113 605 sease 21 16 NA NA 37 sehem NA 43 314 104 461 sehud 21 NA NA NA 21 sehuv NA 36 295 106 437 sekaa NA NA NA 9 9 sekir 21 144 318 115 598 sekkr 21 157 171 NA 349 selek 21 118 208 102 449 sella NA NA NA 9 9 selul 21 148 183 NA 352 seoer NA 36 307 106 449 seosd NA 142 311 104 557 seosu 13 NA NA NA 13 seovi 21 59 NA NA 80 sevar 21 NA NA NA 21 sevax NA 133 312 103 548 sevil 21 153 318 29 521 silis 21 35 304 109 469 sipas 21 35 311 79 446 skjav NA 38 301 115 454 skkoj NA 38 301 108 447 skkub NA NA 280 115 395 sklaz NA NA 280 115 395 4.5 Temporal scope Data transfer to the ENRAM data repository become more or less operational in March 2018 (with a gap in July 2018).

["pipeline.html", "6 Processing pipeline 6.1 European pvol 6.2 European pvol to vp 6.3 vp archiving 6.4 vp to vpts", " 6 Processing pipeline This chapter describes the processing pipeline from pvol over vp to vpts data. 6.1 European pvol BALTRAD collects pvol data for Europe. For pvol data to be available in BALTRAD, several conditions need to be met: A country should send both reflectivity and radial velocity data to the OPERA data centre, which is called ODYSSEY. While many countries are sending reflectivity data, radial velocities are still unavailable for many countries. ODYSSEY should forward these data to the BALTRAD datahub. It is standard policy to do so, but in practice data is not yet forwarded correctly for some radars/countries. Currently BALTRAD and ODYSSEY store data at a 15 minute interval, higher resolution data is not yet available. 6.2 European pvol to vp A server at BALTRAD processes any incoming pvol data with vol2bird. This pipeline is maintained by Günther Haase (SMHI). The resulting vp files are stored for 2 days on a private FTP server to which we have access. The used vol2bird version is stored in the metadata of the vp files and can differ over time. The latest files are created with vol2bird 0.3.20 (last tested April 11, 2019). 6.3 vp archiving European vp data are archived daily by a pipeline running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which transfers vp files from the BALTRAD FTP server to a public S3 bucket. This pipeline is maintained by Stijn Van Hoey (Open science lab for biodiversity) and its code and documentation are available in this repository. Note that any issues in the pipeline that are not resolved within 2 days (the time vp data are kept on the FTP server) can result in data loss. The pipeline also updates a coverage file and bundles vp files in monthly zips per radar (e.g. bejab201904.zip). A public website allows easier file navigation of the S3 bucket. United States vp data are currently not archived. See issue. 6.4 vp to vpts Not yet defined, but likely part of the ENRAM pipeline (see 6.3). "],

These open data will be released under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver; formatted following open domain standards such as the ODIM bird profile specification; and documented with metadata describing their contributors, provenance, resolution, temporal and spatial coverage, and how to use these with open source software developed or contributed to by this project. To help users discover the data generated through this project, we will also develop an easy-to-use interface for the exploration of data at different spatial and temporal scales and offer derived data products that are ready to use in analyses. Materials supporting publications, such as software scripts and derived data products, will be deposited in open research repositories as well. "]
