["1_introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Research purpose 1.2 Data manager 1.3 How this DMP is maintained", " 1 Introduction 1.1 Research purpose Migratory animals play significant roles in shaping ecosystems through a variety of transport and trophic effects that also represent services and disservices to human infrastructure, agriculture and welfare. Their aerial and terrestrial habitats have changed dramatically over the past decades and are expected to change further, particularly due to rapid climate change, increased urbanization, wind energy installations, and habitat fragmentation. Within GloBAM: Towards monitoring, understanding and forecasting global biomass flows of aerial migrants, we aim to use weather radar data to quantify the biomass flows of aerial migrants (birds, insects and bats) from regional to continental scales across Europe and North America, over time-scales from days to years. We are particularly interested in identifying the drivers of migrant movements and abundances and will relate the timing and intensity of movements to a suite of atmospheric, climatic and landscape variables, exploring the implications for aerial migrants in a changing world. For more information on GloBAM, see the project website. 1.2 Data manager Peter Desmet is responsible for data management and DMP maintenance in GloBAM. He is also leading WP1 - Data infrastructure. Peter works as open data coordinator for the Open science lab for biodiversity at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). He and his team have extensive expertise and experience with data management and open data publication meeting FAIR principles. 1.3 How this DMP is maintained This DMP is maintained and versioned on GitHub at https://github.com/enram/globam-dmp/. Each chapter is an R Markdown file (Rmd) in the src directory of that GitHub repository. You can access it directly by clicking the pencil icon in the top navigation of the website version of this DMP. Changes to the R Markdown files can be made by contributors to the GitHub repository or suggested by anyone as pull requests. Textual changes can be done directly on GitHub, code changes are better tested in RStudio first. Accepted changes (i.e. changes to the master branch) will trigger an automatic build procedure that will generate a new version of the DMP using the R package bookdown. The date of the build is used as the version number. "],
["2_pvol_europe.html", "2 European radar data (pvol) 2.1 Source 2.2 License 2.3 Geographical scope 2.4 Temporal scope 2.5 Format 2.6 File name conventions 2.7 Quality assurance 2.8 Storage &amp; backup", " 2 European radar data (pvol) This chapter describes polar volume (pvol) data from European weather radars. It is one the main data sources for GloBAM. 2.1 Source European pvol data are collected by weather radars from national weather services in Europe. They have different approaches in processing, archiving and providing access to pvol data (from restricted access to open data). Even though some GloBAM partners (e.g. the University of Amsterdam) have archived subsets of these data for research use, the scattered scope and access to European pvol data is a serious barrier to GloBAM, which ideally requires access to all European pvol data using the same protocol. The best source for consolidated pvol data is therefore BALTRAD, managed by SMHI (contact person: Günther Haase). pvol data are archived there, but access to that server is restricted to SMHI. See 5.1 for details on how pvol data are submitted to this archive. The rest of this chapter discusses the specifics of the BALTRAD archive. 2.2 License European radar data exchange is coordinated by the European Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information (EUMETNET/OPERA). GloBAM has access to these data via the EIG EUMETNET license agreement for Research use of OPERA data, which grants a specific list of people (involved in ENRAM and GloBAM) access to radar data from selected countries under the following conditions (excerpt): The Licensor grants the Licensees a non-Exclusive license to use intellectual property belonging to the EUMETNET members as defined below [ … ] The OPERA Members Data will be provided for use within the ENRAM Project for the purpose of extracting animal migration information for scientific research. The Grant of this License does not permit use of the OPERA Members Data licensed to be used for commercial purposes or exploitation for profit. The license agreement allows us to access European pvol data for the sole purpose of extracting animal migration information for scientific research, which is what GloBAM intends to do. Storing, sharing or other use of these data is restricted and requires prior written consent of the Licensor. 2.3 Geographical scope OPERA manages a list of radars, their unique codes (e.g. odimcode) and associated metadata. The list currently contains 232 radars. This OPERA database is available as an interactive map derived from a json file containing the metadata. To keep track of changes, we archive this json on GitHub every time we update the DMP. The license agreement allows access to data from 20 countries: country iso_code radars operational Austria AT 5 5 Belgium BE 4 4 Croatia HR 3 3 Denmark DK 5 5 Estonia EE 2 2 Finland FI 11 10 France FR 31 25 Germany DE 20 19 Israel IL 1 1 Netherlands NL 3 2 Norway NO 11 11 Poland PL 8 8 Portugal PT 4 3 Slovakia SK 4 4 Slovenia SI 2 2 Spain ES 15 15 Sweden SE 12 12 Switzerland CH 5 5 United Kingdom GB 16 16 Total - 162 152 The BALTRAD archive does not contain pvol data for all of these radars/countries however (see 5.1). Its precise geographical scope is currently unknown, but being gathered. 2.4 Temporal scope The temporal scope of the BALTRAD archive is currently unknown, but being gathered. GloBAM needs a 2-3 year archive of European pvol and derived vp data to tackle its research questions. By starting from a pvol archive, the generation of vp data can be reproduced if need be, e.g. to make sure adequate vol2bird settings/versions are used. The pvol archive at BALTRAD is likely to be the best source for this archive, but its scope and quality need to be assessed before we can proceed, see 2.7. 2.5 Format The delivery of European pvol data is defined in the license agreement: The Licensor will make the OPERA Members Data available to the Licensees in accordance to the following data description and technical specifications: Single-site polar volumes containing reflectivity, optionally also Doppler velocity, uncorrected reflectivity and dual-pol parameters. Data model ODIM as described in OPERA pages of the EUMETNET website (http://www.eumetnet.eu) Update frequency – 15 minutes Issue time – up to 120 minutes after data time Format: HDF5 Delivery method: FTP via Internet using an ad hoc server. A username and password will be created for ENRAM. Availability of OPERA Members Data will be on the basis of reasonable endeavour Support: OPERA documents are available from the EUMETNET website’s OPERA pages (http://www.eumetnet.eu). OPERA Program Manager will manage technical questions related to the OPERA Products but may address more complicated issues to a team member who may charge a fee. Data is thus provided for every 15 minutes as hdf5 in the OPERA ODIM_h5 format. These files can be read in bioRad with read_pvolfile(). 2.6 File name conventions File names are generally of the format bejab_pvol_20190620T055500Z_0x9.h5, where: be: two-letter code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) jab: three-letter code (last 3 letters from the ODIM code, see 2.3) _pvol_: indication that this is a pvol data file 20190620: date in yyyymmdd format T055000Z: time in hhmmss format + timezone (Z for UTC time) _0x9: suffix (to be ignored) 2.7 Quality assurance The scope and quality of the BALTRAD archive were assessed in an April 2020 workshop, the results of which can be found in this wiki. The conclusion is the collecting good data through BALTRAD going forward might be challenging because of filtering in some countries (e.g. France and Germany), while it is a good source for historic polar volumes between 2012-2018. 2.8 Storage &amp; backup European pvol data are stored on the BALTRAD archive, managed and financed by SMHI. The archive is a restricted FTP server, only accessible to SMHI (see 5.1). "],

It is one the main data sources for GloBAM. 3.1 Source US pvol data are collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which operates a network of approximately 160 Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD), WSR-88D sites in the US and associated territories. Archived polar volumes (pvols) (called “level II data” in the US) are stored on various services: Amazon S3, see NEXRAD on AWS. Archived data are hosted in the noaa-nexrad-level2 Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 AWS region. These data are made available 10-20 minutes lag relative to real-time. There is also a real-time data stream, for which scans have not been merged yet into polar volumes. Google Cloud. 3.2 License There are no restrictions on the use of these data. 3.3 Geographical scope The NEXRAD network covers continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, South Korea and Puerto Rico. Sites in use vary slightly over time, see here for more information, maps here. Figure 3.1: NEXRAD radar network in the lower 48 states 3.4 Temporal scope The archive spans from June 1991 to present. However, during this time significant changes have been made. A resolution increase was implemented in 2008-2009 (so-called superresolution data). Dual polarization capabilities were added in 2010-2013. 3.5 Format See this page for available decoding tools of the radar format. US pvol data can be read in bioRad with read_pvolfile(). 3.6 File name conventions From the AWS open data project documentation for archive data: Each volume scan file of archival data is available as an object in Amazon S3. The basic data format is: /&lt;Year&gt;/&lt;Month&gt;/&lt;Day&gt;/&lt;NEXRAD Station/&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; Where: &lt;Year&gt; is the year the data was collected &lt;Month&gt; is the month of the year the data was collected &lt;Day&gt; is the day of the month the data was collected &lt;NEXRAD Station&gt; is the NEXRAD ground station (map of ground stations) &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file containing the data. These are compressed files (compressed with gzip). The file name has more precise timestamp information. All files in the archive use the same compressed format (.gz). The data file names are, for example, KAKQ20010101_080138.gz. The file naming convention is: GGGGYYYYMMDD_TTTTTT Where: GGGG = Ground station ID (map of ground stations) YYYY = year MM = month DD = day TTTTTT = time when data started to be collected (GMT) Note that the 2015 files have an additional field on the file name. It adds “_V06” to the end of the file name. An example is KABX20150303_001050_V06.gz. 3.7 Quality assurance Unknown. 3.8 Storage &amp; backup US pvol data are stored on AWS and other cloud services, see 3.1. "],

["5_pipeline.html", "5 Processing pipeline 5.1 European pvol 5.2 European pvol to vp 5.3 vp archiving 5.4 vp to vpts", " 5 Processing pipeline This chapter describes the processing pipeline from pvol over vp to vpts data. 5.1 European pvol BALTRAD collects pvol data for Europe. For pvol data to be available in BALTRAD, several conditions need to be met: A country should send both reflectivity and radial velocity data to the OPERA data centre, which is called ODYSSEY. While many countries are sending reflectivity data, radial velocities are still unavailable for many countries. ODYSSEY should forward these data to the BALTRAD datahub. It is standard policy to do so, but in practice data is not yet forwarded correctly for some radars/countries. Currently BALTRAD and ODYSSEY store data at a 15 minute interval, higher resolution data is not yet available. 5.2 European pvol to vp A server at BALTRAD processes any incoming pvol data with vol2bird. This pipeline is maintained by Günther Haase (SMHI). The resulting vp files are stored for 2 days on a private FTP server to which we have access. The used vol2bird version is stored in the metadata of the vp files and can differ over time. The latest files are created with vol2bird 0.3.20 (last tested April 11, 2019). 5.3 vp archiving European vp data are archived daily by a pipeline running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which transfers vp files from the BALTRAD FTP server to a public S3 bucket. This pipeline is maintained by the Open science lab for biodiversity and its code and documentation are available in this repository. Note that any issues in the pipeline that are not resolved within 2 days (the time vp data are kept on the FTP server) can result in data loss. The pipeline also updates a coverage file and bundles vp files in monthly zips per radar (e.g. bejab201904.zip). A public website allows easier file navigation of the S3 bucket. United States vp data are currently not archived. See https://github.com/enram/globam-dmp/issues/19 5.4 vp to vpts Not yet defined, but likely to be part of the ENRAM pipeline (see 5.3). "],

Vertical profiles contain the speed, direction and density of aerial migrants at different altitudes for a specific radar location and time, and form the source data for GloBAM specifically and aeroecological research in general. 6.1 Source European vp data are generated daily from pvol data on the BALTRAD server (see 5.2) and then transferred to the public ENRAM data repository (see ??). United States vp data are being generated for the 25 year pvol archive, but not yet publicly archived. vp files can be downloaded from the ENRAM data repository individually, as monthly zips, or automatically in bioRad with download_vpfiles(). 6.2 License Data in the ENRAM data repository are available as open data under a Creative Commons Zero waiver.

Data packages published on Zenodo are assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for easier referencing (both a generic one and one for each updated version). 8.3 License Data will be published under a Creative Commons Zero waiver. 8.4 Metadata Data will be documented with metadata describing the contributors, provenance, resolution, temporal and spatial coverage, and how to use these with open source software developed or contributed to by GloBAM. 8.5 Standards Data will be kept in their source format, i.e. the ODIM bird profile format specification (see 6.5). 8.6 Frequency Data will be published on Zenodo every two years. Closer to real-time data are already publicly available in the ENRAM data repository. "]
